      computer screen, this product is NOT for you.
      Why have date cubes in the first place? It's more than just a date reminder, it's fun, it's art, and it's a story. And this product fulfills all of those intents. It is literally HAND-MADE by craftsmen in northwestern India. You can see this in a video on their website. I contacted them and asked them about the wood. It is locally grown poplar. I did some research on this, and apparently the poplar originated from the United States Eastern Cottonwood, but special cultivars have been developed specifically for the climate of northwestern India, where it is grown by farmers and now forms a critical part of the economy there. So, the piece actually has meaning, a story which I can enjoy each time I look at it, which will be daily.

      As you can see in the photo, the sizing is slightly imperfect, with "AUGUST" mostly exposed when it's supposed to be "MAY." But what I've done is placed it on top of my PC cabinet so it's literally at eye level and looks perfect that way. The poplar wood has a bit of a black grain to it, making it more interesting. Four colors of ink are used instead of one, making for interesting color combinations each day. The piece was smaller than expected - the ball point pen in the picture gives you an idea of size - but I actually like the size now because it doesn't take up much space or get too distracting.`,
